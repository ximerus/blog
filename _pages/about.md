Hello, my dear reader. My name is Sergey ximerus Khariuk  
And it's my blog. A part of my blog will be in russian language because it's my native language. I'm Ukrainian, I was born in Moldova, so I have more than one native language.  
For now, I'm easy talking in russian, Ukrainian, and English, also I'm learning Portuguese.  
My blog includes the following main topics:  
* Tech - any technical content mostly about cybersecurity
* Life - content that will be about my personal life, including my family
* Books - there will be content about reading books, my thoughts about them, and my explanation of what I've learned.

For now, it would be built on russian content, but in the future, I'm planning to migrate the whole blog to English content, so learn English, my young friends.

Actually, for now, that's all description. See you later
