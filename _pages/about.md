Hello, my dear reader. My name is Serhii ximerus Khariuk  
I'm Ukrainian, and I was born in Moldova, so I have more than one native language.    
My blog includes the following main topics:  
* Tech - any technical content mostly about cybersecurity
* Books - there will be content about reading books, my thoughts about them, and my explanation of what I've learned
* Personal thoughts - random data from my brain
