# Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects
This is the note for the Coursera course [about how to learn effectively](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) here. I'll make notes for myself, and I would be happy if I could help someone with self-improvement.

## Week 1
### Focused versus Diffuse Thinking
#### Introduction to Focused and Diffuse modes
Homo sapiens have excellent tools to learn and improve themselves, and it's a brain. To be less frustrated during the learning process, we must understand our brains better. So, as a starting point of our journey, let's use differentiation for modes in which our brain works. It's focused and diffused modes.
Focus mode is a mode of concentration on something we learn.
Diffuse mode - this mode is about a simple and non-concentrated statement.

When we are in focused mode, our brain activates much more neurons to have more capability to process data. Still, at the same time, it works only with predefined communication patterns through the neurons. To create new ways of communication in our neural system, we have a diffuse mode where our brain activates fewer neurons but increases brain capability to develop new communication patterns.
But our brains can't work simultaneously in both modes or quickly between them, so the future section will describe how great minds use diffuse methods to make great things.

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse modes
Salvador Dali - has a great technique to pass through the Diffuse mode: he took the key in his hand and tried to relax in the chair. When he brings into 1st phase of sleep(diffuse mode), the key brings him down and wakes him up. As a result, he switches between diffuse and focus mode and brings new connections to focus mode using it.
The same technique was used by Thomas Edison.
As a bottom line, we can say that to have an effective learning process, we need to have the ability to switch between diffuse and focused modes. Like in the gym, we exercise and take a break.

#### What is Learning?
Learning is the process of making stronger synapses connections between the neurons.

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep
#### Procrastination
The cause of procrastination is an activation of the brain part, which is responsible for pain. Basically, the brain doesn't differentiate between physical pain, mental pain, and pain that could happen in the future, so to prevent a "pain" from non-likely working, our brain tries to focus on something more understandable and painless to him.
But during the research, scientists have discovered the next: If a person starts to work on something that he doesn't like, in some time, painful activation goes lower and disappears. An excellent technique to be in focused mode is the Pomodoro technique when you use a 25-minute timer to work focused and gain 5 minutes of relaxation.

#### Practice makes permanent
A repeated chain of the same actions creates stable connections between neurons, the same principle as for habits.

#### Introduction to memory
People have two types of memory:
* Working memory - it's a prefrontal area of the brain that can focus on four chunks of memory simultaneously.
* Long-term memory - storing information in long time memory should be done time by time accessed to renew connections between neurons.

To convert something into long-term memory, cycling should be repeated during the week with some spaces between learning days to relax and move focus into another area.

#### Importance of sleep in the learning process
During the awake statement, we generate toxins that are removed through sleep.
Sleep is also essential for learning because the sleeping brain moves data from working memory to long-term memory.

#### Summary
Our brains work in two different modes. Combining these modes with more effective use of your brain and abilities is critical to effective learning. Splitting focus mode into chunks of 25 minutes and sleep is also crucial for learning and effectiveness.
